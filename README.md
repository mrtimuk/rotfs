# rotfs

This is a kernel module skeleton from a tutorial that I'm hoping to turn into a 
rotating filesystem. It'll behave a fixed size ring-buffer for automatically 
rotating and deleting files such as logs.

This is not the kind of filesystem that you want to use to store your important 
documents and sentimental photos.
